- Full stack JavaScript/TypeScript development and DevOps for front end,
back end, and cloud infrastructure
- Modern JavaScript, Babel, React, and Material Design via Material UI
framework and styled components for the front end
- Node.js, Express, Redis, GraphQL, and MSSQL on the back end
- Cloud stack utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) with multiple ECS Docker
containers across regions monitored with Sentry, Logz.io, and builds using AWS
CodeBuild
- Wrote Webpack plugins to improve developer workflow by automating build
steps and improve performance by moving runtime costs to build time
- Updated Express REST APIs to GraphQL queries for improved performance,
type checking, and code quality
- Improved server and client speed by chunking build and utilizing loadable
code and components
- Modernized JS code to use async/await syntax and Flow/TypeScript types
- Offloaded multi-lingual strategy to build time string compilation
instead of run time string building
- Rewrote server-side rendering to stream responses to improve response time
and pre-cache most highest impact queries
- Performed DevOps tasks such as improving continuous integration, deploying
builds, and improving development workflows
- Wore many hats and did much outside a traditional software engineering role
being a small startup with big ambitions
